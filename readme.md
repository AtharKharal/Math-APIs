# Mathematics-based Web APIs Documentation

This repository hosts the source files for the **Mathematics-based Web APIs Documentation Site**, built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

## ðŸ“– Overview

The site introduces the concept of offering **mathematical problem-solving and algorithms as web-based APIs**. It demonstrates how modern documentation frameworks can make these APIs accessible, understandable, and developer-friendly.

## ðŸš€ Live Site

The documentation is automatically deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) using **GitHub Actions**.

## ðŸ›  Local Development

```bash
# 1. Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
