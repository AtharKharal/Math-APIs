Here’s a list of **graph theory–based problems in the space and LEO satellite domain** that CASPAM could target, specifically with an **API-first approach** so results are consumable by other systems or researchers.
I’ve grouped them by problem type and noted the graph theory concepts behind them.

---

## **1. Constellation Connectivity & Routing**

* **Problem:** Determine optimal data routes between any two points on Earth through a moving LEO constellation.
* **Graph Concept:** Shortest path in **time-varying graphs**.
* **API Use Case:**

  * Input: constellation layout, orbital data, ground station locations.
  * Output: optimal route, latency estimates, redundancy paths.

## **2. Orbital Handover Scheduling** *(our current problem)*

* **Problem:** Maintain continuous connection during satellite-ground handovers.
* **Graph Concept:** **Dynamic matching** between assets and satellites over time.
* **API Use Case:**

  * Input: asset position track, satellite ephemeris.
  * Output: timestamped handover plan.

## **3. Frequency Assignment & Interference Avoidance**

* **Problem:** Assign frequencies so no two adjacent satellites (in interference range) share the same channel.
* **Graph Concept:** **Graph coloring**.
* **API Use Case:**

  * Input: satellite adjacency (interference) graph.
  * Output: frequency allocation map, minimal colors used.

## **4. Collision Risk Prediction**

* **Problem:** Identify close approaches between satellites and debris.
* **Graph Concept:** **Proximity graphs** (edges when distance < threshold).
* **API Use Case:**

  * Input: orbital positions for time series.
  * Output: risk graph with edges representing potential collisions, plus recommended avoidance windows.

## **5. Constellation Topology Optimization**

* **Problem:** Design minimal inter-satellite link (ISL) network that maintains global coverage.
* **Graph Concept:** **Minimum spanning tree** or **k-connected subgraph**.
* **API Use Case:**

  * Input: possible ISL candidates, performance constraints.
  * Output: selected ISL layout with connectivity metrics.

## **6. Ground Station Allocation**

* **Problem:** Assign satellites to ground stations to balance load and minimize latency.
* **Graph Concept:** **Bipartite matching** / **assignment problem**.
* **API Use Case:**

  * Input: station locations, satellite coverage zones.
  * Output: optimal allocation schedule over time.

---

## **7. Satellite Task Scheduling (Earth Observation)**

* **Problem:** Assign imaging tasks to satellites to maximize coverage without redundancy.
* **Graph Concept:** **Weighted bipartite matching** / **maximum coverage** problem.
* **API Use Case:**

  * Input: list of targets, satellite availability windows.
  * Output: schedule of which satellite images which target when.

---

## **8. Multi-Hop Relay Planning**

* **Problem:** Relay data from a remote asset via multiple satellites to a ground station when direct link unavailable.
* **Graph Concept:** **k-shortest paths** in time-varying graphs.
* **API Use Case:**

  * Input: asset location, ground station location, satellite ephemeris.
  * Output: multi-hop relay chain with minimal total latency.

If you want, I can prepare a **CASPAM API Roadmap Table** mapping:

* Problem
* Graph theory model
* Key input/output data formats
* API endpoint structure
  This would let you plan **multiple APIs** as a single portfolio rather than building them one-by-one.
