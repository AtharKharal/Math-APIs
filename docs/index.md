# Mathematics-Based Web APIs

Welcome to the **Mathematics-Based Web APIs** documentation site.  
This site introduces how mathematical ideas, algorithms, and problem-solving tools can be delivered as modern **web APIs**. By exposing mathematics through APIs, we create reusable services that developers, researchers, and educators can integrate into applications, simulations, or teaching tools.

## What Are Math APIs?

A **Math API** is an interface that allows programs to request mathematical computations over the web.  
Instead of writing algorithms from scratch, you can send data to an API and receive instant, reliable results. For example:

- Solving a quadratic equation
- Performing vector and matrix operations
- Optimizing functions
- Running simulations in physics or engineering contexts

## Why Use Web APIs for Mathematics?

- **Accessibility**: Make powerful computations available anywhere via the internet.
- **Reusability**: Encapsulate algorithms once and reuse them across projects.
- **Integration**: Connect mathematics with software, mobile apps, or scientific platforms.
- **Scalability**: Run heavy computations on servers instead of local machines.

## What Youâ€™ll Find Here

This site will guide you through:

1. **Getting Started**: How to install, authenticate, and send requests.
2. **APIs**: Ready-to-use endpoints for mathematical problems (e.g., algebra, calculus, optimization).
3. **Guides**: Step-by-step tutorials with practical use cases.
4. **Reference**: Detailed specifications, error codes, and OpenAPI definitions.
5. **Changelog**: Track updates and improvements.

## Example: Quadratic Roots API

```
POST /roots
{
  "a": 1,
  "b": -3,
  "c": 2
}
```

Response:

```
{
  "roots": [1, 2]
}
```
